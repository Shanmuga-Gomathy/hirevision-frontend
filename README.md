## What is HireVision?

HireVision is a demo project that lets you:
- Register as a job seeker, recruiter, or admin
- Upload your resume (PDF/DOCX) and get AI-powered job recommendations
- Apply for jobs, track your applications, and get notified if you're shortlisted
- Post jobs as a recruiter, view applicants, and send custom messages
- Experience real-world security: recruiter approval, email verification, JWT authentication, and role-based access

All wrapped in a clean, responsive, and professional UI built with React and Bootstrap.
